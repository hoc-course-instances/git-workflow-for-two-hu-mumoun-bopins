        <p>
            Workin' on a laptop, close to the end
            Of a job I've been doing since half past ten
            I don't believe that it's frozen again
            The system has gone down-o, down-o, down-o
            I don't believe that it's frozen again
            The system has gone down-o
            So I took it down to the help desk guy
            And I said "make it better or I'm gonna cry"
            He said, "I'm sorry, your computer has died,
            And the data can no longer be found-o, found-o, found-o"
            He said, "I'm sorry your computer has died
            The data can no longer be found-o"
            To the roof with the laptop I did go
            Over to the edge and I gave it a throw
            And when it arrived seven stories below
            It really made a mighty fine sound-o, sound-o, sound-o
            And when it arrived seven stories below
            It really made a mighty fine sound-o
            Well, that didn't do enough to ease my pain
            So I went down to dulles and I got on a plane
            Sayin' "this is all billy gates's fault
            And I'm gonna be trackin' him down-o, down-o, down-o"
            Sayin' "this is all billy gates's fault
            And I'm gonna be trackin' him down-o."
            Touched down in seattle and got off the plane
            Hit starbucks to get out of the rain
            Paid all of my dough for a thimble of joe
            Full o' foam and the cinnamon brown-o, brown-o, brown-o
            Paid all of my dough for a thimble of joe
            Full o' foam and the cinnamon brown-o
            When the gates found out about my plan
            He packed up his bag, turned tail and ran
            Megalo-man took it out on the lam
            And hid way underground-o, ground-o, ground-o
            Megalo-man took it out on the lam
            And hid way underground-o
            Well the gates been a-runnin' ever since that day
            He thinks he can hide but he can't get away
            When I finally find his little skinny behind
            Gonna kick it all over this town-o, town-o, town-o
            When I finally find his little skinny behind
            Gonna kick it all over this town</p>
